# Covid Cases App

This Shiny application is meant as a showcase for some of my R-based data science development. <br>
The goals of this exercise are to: <br>
* Leverage public data
* Automate downloading and clean up of the datasets
* Create a reactive web app to display active case counts and daily reported cases
* Build the web app as a package that can be hosted on shinyapps.io
* Leverage clean coding techniques from "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert Martin

To launch the app follow the link below.
